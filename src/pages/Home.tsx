      intro: `The Counterfeit Tee carries a vandalized 50DT note across the chest â€” 
      the central bank scarred, walls tagged, a helicopter circling above. 
      Cut from black polycotton and treated with a stone-wash finish, each 
      shirt bears its own stains, fades, and distressed marks, making no two 
      pieces alike. The fit is regular, unisex, built to wear down and age with time. 
      It's a piece that treats money as fragile, fabric as temporary, and both as 
      canvases for rebellion. 
      
      Money doesn't last. Neither does fabric.`,
